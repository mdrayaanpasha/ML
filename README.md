# ML, But no libraries. 
*"Why use libraries when you can suffer through math yourself?"*  

## 🧠 What is This?  
This repo is a **labor of ~pain~ love** where I code **Fundamental Machine Learning (FML)** algorithms from scratch.  
If ML is a black box, this is me, smashing it open with math and Python—because *why not?*

## 🛠️ What You’ll Find  
A collection of algorithms built purely for the thrill of watching my laptop gasp for air.  

- Linear Regression 🌡️
- Logistic Regression 🎯
- Binomial Distribution 📊
- K Means 🗯️
- Descion Trees 🌲
- Neural Network 🫧
- Vector Embedding 🪡

<br/>
Coming soon: More chaos....

## ⚡ Getting Started

Clone it if you're brave:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdrayaanpasha/ML.git  
cd ML
python algo_name.py 
```
<br/> 
Warning: Expect chaos if you change parameters arbitrarily. 😈
